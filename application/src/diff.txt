differences from MSNC 1.0 (JAVA):

pros:
    no semicolons
    no need for spaces anymore, code read char by char
    multiple loops / conditions on the same LINE
    multiple lines of code on the same LINE with |
    strings have their own syntax inside ""
    no need to declare types
    method syntax is cleaner with ~ and >
    loops CAN incorporate a variable with {START:END:VAR} syntax
    allows for classes with methods, ex. Local , System
    improved variable and method destruction capabilities
    faster instruction interpretation (closer to a linear approach)
    better flexibility with boolean expressions
    one instruction can span across multiple lines with ``
    array's 'each' method allows for faster looping through arrays
    faster recent method execution with ^^^
    

cons:
    no object recreation (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)



boolean operators:
    &&    :       ==
    &&-   :       <
    &&+   :       >
    &&-e  :       <=
    &&+e  :       >=
    !&&   :       !=

Main classes:

    System
    Local
    Boolean
    Object
    (Custom Object name)
